Architecture
------------

A combination NURBS/meshed surface store.

Defines a single array of vertices, single array
of texture coordinates, single array of NURBS 3D control points,
single array of NURBS 3D  knots, single array of NURBS 2D control points,
single array of NURBS 2D knots, etc.

Spaces in these arrays can be allocated and locked.
Locking can be by the entire array, or subregions, and can be
read only or read write.  There must be an order for locking the
different arrays, and subregions of the arrays can be locked independently,
ordered by array position and size. Initially only locking of the entire
array will actually be implemented, but this could be improved later.

Hierarchical assemblies and parts will be defined by reference into
these master arrays.
